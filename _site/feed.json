            "content_text": "Why do so many Americans hate our cities stateside but flock to the cobblestone streets of European ones? The short and simple answer is because of the car.You see, American cities have been built for the car, meaning they prioritize the movement of vehicles and their occupants over every other means of mobility. The impact here is there are no cobblestone streets to speak of and most journeys are not pleasant affairs.It may seem like a trivial concern that most of our cities are not walkable. However, the impact of designing for cars leads to much bigger and structural issues. The approach exacerbates climate change, limits mobility and economic opportunity for minoritized communities, and has claimed too many pedestrians’ lives.As cities work to address these 21st challenges, leaning on cars is not only futile but is actively counter-productive. To make real progress, the United States must foster alternative, people-centric modes of mobility instead. “People-centric” modes are those that emphasize the pedestrian and their movement without the use of a car. By decreasing reliance on cars, cities can unlock greater economic prosperity, meet the tough climate obligations that lay ahead, and improve citizens’ quality of life.To understand how people-centric mobility addresses these challenges, let us take a look at the underlying mobility issues cities face on a day-to-day basis.Downsides of Car-Centric PlanningUS cities have centered their mobility strategy around the car since cars began mass production at the start of the 20th Century. The result is an urban landscape that prioritizes the car over all other forms of mobility.As proof of the car’s dominance, we needn’t look any further than land-use statistics. In many of America’s largest cities, over 50% of total real estate is dedicated to cars either in the form of roads or parking. Estimates peg the total percentage of land dedicated to roads alone at 42% for Chicago, 37% for Phoenix, and 28% for New York City.The reality is that car-centric infrastructure is not optimized for 21st Century cities.  As cities grapple with the car’s shortcomings, there are a litany of issues demanding cities’ attention…Cities are experiencing high-levels of congestion impacting productivity and residents’ wellbeingIt is estimated that the average American spends 100 hours sitting in traffic each year, valued at an estimated $88BN total or roughly $1,500 per person. The impact is worse in the most congested cities: $2,000+ per year in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York. Leading urban planner and economist Alain Bertaud describes congestion as “as a tax on a city’s productivity” in his book Order Without Design  — these totals illustrate why.Congestion also increases the total air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the chronic disease burden associated with extended time spent in a car.The root cause of congestion in the United States is an over-reliance on cars and the lack of alternative mobility means. Unfortunately, it is likely to get worse without intervention as the continued growth of  rideshare and e-commerce is increasing the number of vehicles on the road with no natural end in sight.Pedestrian safety has also decreased over the past decade, resulting in an estimated ~6.6K pedestrian fatalities in 2019In 2019, the Governors Highway Safety Association estimated that 6.6k pedestrians were killed in fatal interactions with cars, representing 17% of total fatalities from car accidents (39K total). This is a 5% increase from a decade prior when pedestrian fatalities accounted for only 12% of the total.These statistics are the product of an increasing number of vehicles on the road and an increase in those vehicles’ size, which are ultimately rooted in cars-centric planning policies and car culture.Historically mobility inequity has disproportionately affected marginalized and minoritized communitiesIn American cities today, Black &amp; Hispanic households are less likely to have access to cars, quality public transit, and alternative mode of mobility.Research from the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) has found that Black households living below the poverty line have access to 7% fewer transit trips per week and routes that are less likely to operate on a high-frequency schedule than white households. Furthermore, CNT found that Black households have less access to bikeshare and carshare and when utilizing rideshare services (i.e., Uber &amp; Lyft), African Americans’ experience longer wait times.The lack of mobility alternatives is especially impactful in light of the divergence in car ownership, splitting along race and ethnicity: 40% of Black &amp; Hispanic households living in poverty do not own a car, compared to 28% of white households.The decreased mobility affecting communities of color results in less access to employment and labor markets, constraining economic opportunity.CNT also found that across a sample of 10 large US metros, African Americans had access to 31% fewer jobs requiring an associate’s degree within a 30-minute commute. Limited jobs in close proximity translates to longer commutes, with approximately 40% of African Americans and Hispanics living in poverty commuting for over an hour by public transit to access employment.Personal transportation accounts for approximately 17% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United StatesDecreasing total emissions from personal transportation is paramount to mitigating the worst impacts of climate change and meet the US’ obligations under the Paris Climate Accord. While the transition to electric vehicles is an important goal to pursue, electric vehicles will continue to contribute to emissions the current power grid continues to draws upon fossil fuels for energy production.The combustion of fossil fuels also contributes to high levels of air pollution, resulting in huge public health impacts and premature deathsResearchers at Duke estimated that over the next 50 years air pollution will cause 4.5 million premature deaths, 3.5 million hospitalizations, and 300 million lost workdays, but a transition away from fossil fuels would prevent these impacts. The resulting economic benefits from mitigating the losses in life, public health impacts, and subsequent productivity losses would justify the costs of the energy transition alone.Four Pillars to Support People-Centric MobilityAddressing the issues associated with car-centric policy, namely congestion, pedestrian safety, unequal access to mobility, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution, as well as the bigger challenges these led to, specifically climate change, increasing inequality, and decreasing growth, is critical for cities’ continued vitality. I believe cities should make “right-sizing” their mobility infrastructure a cornerstone of their approach to these issues, ultimately supporting a transition to a people-centric mobility paradigm.So what does people-centric mobility look like and how can cities build towards it?“People-centric” mobility emphasizes the pedestrian and their movement, moving away from relying on cars to prioritizing walking and micromobility1 instead. Bolstering public transportation is also critical for people-centric mobility, as multi-modal trips2 are crucial to the strategy’s success. By enabling residents to travel further without the need for a car, public transit boosts the utility of complementary modes such as walking or cycling.While people-centric mobility requires the increased adoption of a wide range of mobility modes and devices, the good news is the infrastructure and policies needed to support each mode are complementary — for instance, supporting walkers almost always benefits cyclists and public transit users as well.Cities can support people-centric mobility by prioritizing the following four pillars.Pillar 1: Build better pedestrian and bike infrastructureDedicated infrastructure programs induce demand3 for cycling and pedestrian activities as well as bolstering pedestrian safety. Just as the construction of additional roadways induces demand for driving, pedestrian and bike infrastructure does the same for walking, cycling, and micromobility.Demand is induced due mainly by the decreased effort required to complete a trip by bicycle or on foot, stemming from availability of shorter routes and increased safety. In a car-centric city walkers and cyclists are often forced to take circuitous routes to ensure their safety. When there aren’t viable routes, many residents will resort to using a car. Dedicated infrastructure enables more direct routes for cyclists and walkers by protecting these vulnerable road users from car traffic.In tandem with building dedicated infrastructure, cities should continue to expand bikeshare programs to support a greater number of trip types. Doing so has been shown to further induce demand for cycling as well as public transits, as well as deliver secondary benefits to cyclist safety. It turns out that the presence of bikeshare increases drivers’ awareness of cyclists, thereby increasing drivers’ caution for cyclists who share the road.Pillar 2: Support the development and deployment of new micromobility modes and form factorsThe wide-scale adoption of bicycles for urban trips faces hurdles due to bicycles’ natural abilities. Most bikes lack carrying capacity, constraining bicycles’ utility for shopping; biking requires significant effort, constraining bikes’ utility for longer trips (e.g., commuting); and bikes lack protection from the elements, resulting in seasonal ridership trends. The good news is the emergence of electric pedal-assist bicycles (e-bikes) and other micromobility form factors, like e-scooters, cargo bikes, and mini-cars, can help overcome many of these constraints.E-bikes are ideal for commuting as they decrease the overall strain required and lower the barrier for use. Research conducted by bicycle insurance provider Bikmo found that 33% of surveyed individuals with e-bikes use them for commuting, signaling increasing adoption for trips when riders are looking to minimize exertion.Cargo bikes and cargo e-bikes are enabling personal and commercial users to complete trips that previously required a car or commercial vehicle for the added capacity. In Germany, IKEA has begun to rent cargo e-bikes to their customers for transporting larger goods home and in many North American cities, large parcel carriers like FedEx and UPS are testing cargo e-bikes for deliveries.Further innovation of new form factors is ongoing. For commercial use, Germany’s ONO recently raised 3 million euros to produce a new e-tricycle more closely resembling a van more than a trike. The benefits of the design include a powerful pedal-assist electric motor, an enclosed cabin to ward out the elements, and significant cargo-carrying capacity. For personal use, Citroen is deploying a fleet of their new Ami quadricycle in the streets of Paris. While the Ami looks like a car, it weighs in at a little under 500kg and only tops out at 45kmh (~28mph). Due to its classification as a quadricycle, it can even be driven by licensed users as young as 14-years old!Cities can support adoption of these modes by updating their policies to ensure these new modes are legal for the road and are protected as vulnerable road users. These new mobility modes are often larger and more expensive, so providing secure parking and storage infrastructure as well as anti-theft or insurance programs can decrease the risk for households interesting in making these large purchases.Pillar 3: Boost service levels of public transit and deploy new mobility services to better support commutes between neighborhood centersCOVID has changed mobility patterns in cities, eliminating the commute for many professionals and increasing the importance of mobility for essential workers. Both phenomena are likely to persist in the near-term as office leases run out, teleworking becomes more common, and cities focus on economic recovery.Therefore, cities do not need to prioritize mobility for peak commuters to the same degree as they do today. Instead, cities need to provide greater support for inter- and intra-neighborhood travel, which makes up a higher proportion of trips as people substitute commutes for personal trips.Prioritizing these new transit patterns requires city transit agencies to adjust schedules to support off-peak travel and expand routes to enable greater trips between more dispersed locations. Cities should also work to support new shared mobility options, such as increasing the number of e-bikes in bikeshare fleets or expanding permitting for dockless e-scooters. Both examples benefit inter- and intra-neighborhood trips. Supporting micromobility complements public transit, increasing demand for public transit services and making cities’ mobility ecosystem more flexible, resilient, and people-centric.Pillar 4: Incentivize the adoption of alternative mobility modes using subsidies &amp; pricing mechanismsProviding consumers with subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles has proved effective for driving  adoption of electric vehicles. Cities can encourage the adoption of new mobility form factors by providing the same for electric micromobility, ultimately resulting in a mode-shift away from cars across a wide range of trip types.In tandem, cities need to begin pricing the externalities of car usage and pass a portion of these costs onto road users. Forcing road users to bear a portion of the externalized costs of car use will push road-users to be more cognizant of the trade-offs associated with their mobility choices.Cities can leverage a wide variety of pricing mechanisms to meet their policy goals, including congestion fees &amp; surcharges, parking fees, curb-use fees, gas taxes, and broader carbon taxes. Cities should select  the mechanism most appropriate for their goals.Price mechanisms also present an opportunity for leaders to communicate the financial benefits of alternative mobility, as car ownership is significantly more expensive. As the total cost of ownership for cars increases further and alternative mobility becomes more accessible with decreasing costs and potential subsidies, the financial case for ditching personal vehicles is compelling.The Benefits of People-Centric MobilityThese four pillars can support a robust people-centric mobility strategy and address the issues associated with the car-centric planning that burden cities today.      Building dedicated infrastructure and increasing the awareness of drivers to alternative road users boosts pedestrian safety, driving down the fatality rate that has climbed over the last decade.        Increasing the usage of alternative mobility decreases the usage of cars, reducing the total greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and resulting health impacts.        Supporting the wider range of trip types common in the post-COVID cities increases mobility access and the equity of a city’s mobility landscape.        Perhaps the most convincing argument is the benefit to the remaining drivers: decreasing the number of cars on cities’ roads and highways decreases congestion.  In addition to addressing the pressing issues facing cities, people-centric mobility generates a number of secondary benefits.      Increasing the number of active commutes generates additional public health benefits, resulting in a healthier and happier population.        Increasing the volume of pedestrians on cities’ streets leads to an increase in economic activity. Contrary to many business owners’ fears, the removal of parking and expansion of sidewalks and bike lanes is shown to increase customer spending. Perhaps unsurprisingly, pedestrians are more likely to stop and shop than drivers buzzing by in their car.  Ultimately, I believe prioritizing people-centric mobility will make cities more resilient in the face of the 21st Century’s challenges. Not only that, but prioritizing people over cars will result in happier populations and a more productive, creative, and innovative city.            Micromobility includes bicycles 🚲, scooters 🛴, mopeds 🛵, tricycles &amp; quadricycles 🛺, mini-cars 🚗, clown cars 🤡, and other yet-to-emerge innovations and form-factors 🚜. &#8617;              Multi-modal trips use various types of mobility, such as walking and the bus or using bikeshare and the subway. &#8617;              Induced demand refers to effect on demand for driving caused by the construction of new roadways. As road capacity is expanded, the additional capacity is quickly filled by new drivers. If you build it (highways), they will come (to drive), or some such &#8617;      ",
