Merriam Webster defines **mobility** in two ways:

1. the quality or state of being mobile or movable;

2. the ability to change one's social or socioeconomic position in a community and especially to improve it.

While the dictionary definition does not explicitly link (1) physical mobility and (2) social & economic mobility, the two are inherently intertwined. If a citizen is unable to tap into the economic benefits of a city because their mobility is physically limited, their ability to change their social and economic standing decreases as well.

As such, physical mobility is critically important for all citizens' lives and is a key area of focus for municipal, state, & federal governments.

In the United States today, physical mobility relies primarily on automobiles, the result of years of auto-centric transportation and planning policies. The automobile has been and continues to be one of the most influential forces in American cities and Americans' lives.

However, as we approach the challenges of the 21st Century, including combating climate change, reducing inequality, and fostering economic growth, reliance on automobiles alone is an increasingly futile strategy.

To tackle the challenges of climate change, inequality, and growth, I believe the United States must foster alternative means of mobility, specifically people-centric modes. "People-centric" mobility modes are those that emphasize the pedestrian and their movement without the use of a car. By decreasing cities' reliance on automobiles, cities can unlock greater economic prosperity, meet the tough climate obligations that lay ahead, and improve the quality of life for all of their citizens.

How does people-centric mobility accomplish this all? Let's take an in-depth look at the issues facing cities today to understand.

## Downsides of Car-Centric Planning

US cities have centered their mobility strategy around the car since cars began mass production at the start of the 20th Century. The result is an urban landscape that prioritizes the automobile over all other forms of mobility.

As proof of the car's dominance, we needn't look any further than land-use statistics. In many of America's largest cities, over 50% of total real estate is dedicated to cars either in the form of roads or parking. Estimates peg the total percentage of land dedicated to roads alone at 42% for Chicago, 37% for Phoenix, and 28% for New York City.

In contrast, the most car-centric European cities dedicate about 25% of land to cars, a proportion that is lower in Europe's most historic cities. Meanwhile, dedicated bike infrastructure represents close to zero percent of land use in the United States, while public transit also commands a relatively small percentage.

The reality is that car-centric infrastructure is not optimized for 21st Century cities.  As cities grapple with the car's shortcomings, there is a litany of issues that demand the bulk of their attention...

#### Cities are experiencing high-levels of congestion impacting productivity and residents' wellbeing

It is estimated that the average American spends 100 hours sitting in traffic each year, valued at an estimated $88BN total or ~$1,500 per person. The impact is worse in the most congested cities: $2,000+ per year in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York. Leading urban planner and economist Alain Bertaud describes congestion as "as a tax on cities' productivity" in his book __Order Without Design__  — these totals illustrate why.

Congestion also increases the total air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the chronic disease burden associated with extended time spent in a car.

The root cause of congestion in the United States is an over-reliance on cars and the lack of alternative mobility means. Unfortunately, it is likely to get worse without intervention as the emergence of new rideshare and e-commerce business models is increasing the number of commercial vehicles on the road with no natural end in sight.

#### Pedestrian safety has also decreased over the past decade, resulting in an estimated ~6.6K pedestrian fatalities in 2019

In 2019, the Governors Highway Safety Association estimated that 6.6k pedestrians were killed in fatal interactions with automobiles, representing 17% of total fatalities from automobile accidents (39K total). This is a 5% increase from a decade prior when pedestrian fatalities accounted for only 12% of the total.

These statistics are the product of an increasing number of vehicles on the road and an increase in those vehicles' size, which are ultimately rooted in cars-centric planning policies and car culture.

#### Mobility inequity disproportionately affects marginalized and minoritized communities in the urban environment. As such, their access to economic opportunities is constrained.

In American cities today, Black & Hispanic households are less likely to have access to automobiles, quality public transit, and alternative mode of mobility.

Research from the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) has found that Black households living below the poverty line have access to 7% fewer transit trips per week and routes that are less likely to operate on a high-frequency schedule than white households. Furthermore, CNT found that Black households have less access to bikeshare and carshare than white and when utilizing rideshare services (Uber & Lyft), African Americans' experience longer wait times.

The lack of mobility alternatives is especially impactful when accessing car ownership by race and ethnicity. 40% of Black & Hispanic households living in poverty do not own a car, compared to 28% of white households.

#### The decreased mobility impacting communities of color results in less access to employment and labor markets.

CNT found that across a sample of 10 large US metros, African Americans had access to 31% fewer jobs requiring an associate's degree within a 30-minute commute. Limited jobs in close proximity translates to longer commutes, with approximately 40% of African Americans and Hispanics living in poverty commuting for over an hour by public transit to access employment.

#### Personal transportation accounts for approximately 17% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

Decreasing total emissions from personal transportation is paramount to mitigating the worst impacts of climate change and meet the US' obligations under the Paris Climate Accord. While the transition to electric vehicles is an important goal to pursue, electric vehicles will continue to contribute to emissions the current power grid continues to draws upon fossil fuels for energy production.

#### The combustion of fossil fuels also contributes to high levels of air pollution, resulting in significant public health impacts and a huge number of premature deaths.

Researchers at Duke estimated the total over the next 50 years includes 4.5 million premature deaths, 3.5 million hospitalizations, and 300 million lost workdays. Transitioning away from the usage of fossil fuels responsible for the pollution would prevent these impacts. The resulting economic benefits from mitigating these losses in life and productivity would justify the costs of the energy transition alone.

## Four Pillars to Support People-Centric Mobility

Addressing the issues associated with car-centric policy, namely congestion, safety, unequal access to mobility, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution, and the bigger challenges these led to, specifically climate change, increasing inequality, and decreasing growth, is critical for cities' continued vitality. I believe cities should make "right-sizing" their mobility infrastructure a cornerstone of their approach to these issues, ultimately supporting a transition to a people-centric mobility paradigm.

So what does people-centric mobility look like and how can cities build towards it?

"People-centric" mobility emphasizes the pedestrian and their movement, turning away from relying mainly on cars and prioritizing walking and micromobility[^1] instead.

Bolstering public transportation is also critical for people-centric mobility, as multi-modal trips[^2] are crucial to the strategy's success. By enabling residents to travel further without the need for a car, public transit boosts the utility of complementary modes such as walking or cycling.

While people-centric mobility requires the adoption of a wide range of mobility modes and devices, the good news is the infrastructure and policies needed to support each mode are complementary — for instance, supporting walkers almost always benefits cyclists and public transit users as well.

What are the pillars cities can use to transition to and support people-centric mobility?

#### Pillar 1: Build better pedestrian and bike infrastructure

Dedicated infrastructure programs induce demand[^3] for cycling and pedestrian activities along with increasing pedestrian safety.

Just as the construction of additional roadways induces demand for driving, pedestrian and bike infrastructure does the same for walking, cycling, and micromobility.

Demand is induced due to the decreased level of effort required to complete a trip by bicycle or on foot, mainly due to shorter routes and increased levels of safety. In a car-centric world, walkers and cyclists often need to take circuitous routes to ensure their safety and when there aren't any, those who are able often resort to using a car. Dedicated infrastructure increases safety, both perceived and realized.

Additionally, cities should pursue continued expansion of bikeshare programs, allowing fleets to support a greater number of trip types. A secondary benefit of bikeshare programs is their impact on driver awareness of cyclists; similar to dedicate bike infrastructure, bikeshare increases awareness of cyclists, thereby increasing the caution of drivers who share the road.

#### Pillar 2: Support the development and deployment of new micromobility modes and form factors

The wide-scale adoption of bicycles for urban trips faces hurdles due to bicycles' natural abilities. Most bikes lack carrying capacity, constraining bicycles' utility for shopping; biking requires significant effort, constraining bikes' utility for longer trips (e.g., commuting); and bikes lack protection from the elements, resulting in seasonal ridership trends. The good news is the emergence of electric pedal-assist bicycles (e-bikes) and other micromobility form factors, like e-scooters, cargo bikes, and mini-cars, can help overcome many of these constraints.

E-bikes are ideal for commuting as they decrease the overall strain required and lower the barrier for use. Research conducted by bicycle insurance provider Bikmo found that 33% of surveyed individuals with e-bikes use them for commuting, signaling increasing adoption for trips when riders are looking to minimize exertion.

Cargo bikes and cargo e-bikes are enabling personal and commercial users to complete trips that previously required a car or commercial vehicle for the added capacity. In Germany, IKEA has begun to rent cargo e-bikes to their customers for transporting larger goods home and in many North American cities, large parcel carriers like FedEx and UPS are testing cargo e-bikes for deliveries.

Further innovation of new form factors is ongoing. For commercial use, Germany's ONO recently raised 3 million euros to produce a new e-tricycle more closely resembling a van more than a trike. The benefits of the design include a powerful pedal-assist electric motor, an enclosed cabin to ward out the elements, and significant cargo-carrying capacity. For personal use, Citroen is deploying a fleet of their new Ami quadricycle in the streets of Paris. While the Ami looks like a car, it weighs in at a little under 500kg and only tops out at 45kmh (~28mph). Due to its classification as a quadricycle, it can even be driven by licensed users as young as 14-years old!

#### Pillar 3: Boost service levels of public transit and deploy new mobility services to better support commutes between neighborhood centers

COVID has changed mobility patterns in cities, eliminating the commute for many professionals and increasing the importance of mobility for essential workers. Both phenomena are likely to persist in the near-term as office leases run out, teleworking becomes more common, and cities focus on supporting economic revival.

Therefore, cities do not need to prioritize mobility for peak commuters to the same degree as they do today. Instead, cities need to prioritize inter- and intra-neighborhood travel, which is constitutes a higher proportion of all trips and people substitute their commutes for an increasing number of personal trips.

Prioritizing these new transit patterns requires city transit agencies to adjust schedules to support off-peak travel and routes to enable greater trips between more dispersed locations. Cities should also work to support new emerging mobility options. The increasing integration of e-bikes into bikeshare fleets makes many of these inter-neighborhood trips easier, while the rollout of dockless e-scooters accomplishes the same for intra-neighborhood trips. Pairing mass transit and micromobility strategies can make cities' mobility infrastructure more flexible, resilient, and people-centric.

#### Pillar 4: Incentivize the adoption of alternative mobility modes using subsidies & pricing mechanisms

Providing consumers with subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles has effectively driven the adoption of EVs. By doing the same for electric micromobility purchases cities can encourage the adoption of new mobility form factors, resulting in a mode-shift away from cars across a wide range of trip types.

In tandem, cities need to begin pricing the externalities of car usage and pass a portion of these costs along to road users. Forcing road users to bear a portion of the externalized costs of car use will push road-users to be more cognizant of the trade-offs in their choice of mobility mode.

Cities can leverage a wide variety of pricing mechanisms to meet their policy goals including congestion fees & surcharges, parking fees, curb-use fees, and broader carbon taxes. Allowing cities to select from the various mechanisms enables them to choose the most appropriate one for their goals.

Price mechanisms also provide an opportunity for leaders to communicate the financial benefits of alternative mobility, as automobile ownership is significantly more expensive. With an increase in the total cost of ownership for cars and increased accessibility through subsidies, the financial case for adopting alternative mobility is strong.

## The Benefits of People-Centric Mobility

These four pillars can support a robust people-centric strategy and address the issues associated with the auto-centric mobility that burden cities today.

Building dedicated infrastructure and increasing awareness of all road users boost pedestrian safety, driving down the fatality rate that has climbed over the last decade.

- Increasing the usage of alternative mobility decreases the usage of cars, reducing both the total greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

- Supporting the wider range of trip types common in the post-COVID cities increases mobility access and the equity of a city's mobility landscape.

- Perhaps the most convincing argument is the benefit to the remaining drivers. Decreasing the number of cars on cities' roads and highways decreases congestion.

In addition to addressing the pressing issues facing cities, people-centric mobility generates a number of secondary benefits.

- Increasing the number of active commutes while decreasing exposure to congestion and air pollution generates huge public health benefits, resulting in a healthier and happier city.

- Increasing the volume of pedestrians on cities' streets leads to an increase in economic activity. Running contrary to many business owners' fears, the removal of parking and expansion of sidewalks and bike lanes is shown to increase customer spending. Shockingly pedestrians are more likely to stop and shop than drivers buzzing by in their car!

Ultimately, I believe prioritizing people-centric mobility will make cities more resilient in the face of the 21st Century's challenges. Not only that, but prioritizing people over cars will result in happier populations and a more productive, creative, and innovative city. Cities are built and sustained by their citizens and their relationships, by placing people at the center of their mobility strategies, cities can tap into the greatest strength and provide a better outcome for all.
