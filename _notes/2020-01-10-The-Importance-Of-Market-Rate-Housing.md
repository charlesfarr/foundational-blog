Why in the world is rent so damn high? The simple answer is that demand for rental housing far outstrips supply, driving up rents.

Since 2001,  the cost of rent has risen by nearly 50% while income has stayed flat. Now, almost 40% of renter households in America are "rent-burdened," defined as putting 30% or more of income towards rent (up from 32% in 2001).

However, there is increasing evidence that the simple act of building market-rate housing can decrease neighborhood rents for everyone.

Research from Germany identified a 3% reduction in rent per square meter for every 0.1% increase in the total housing supply (Mense).

Research from San Francisco identified similar rent reductions from new market-rate housing construction — between 1.2 – 2.3% for units within a 500m radius (Pennington).

Broader research from 11 large US metro areas has found the benefits of building new market-rate housing also exist in lower-income neighborhoods. Large developments (50+ units) decreased rents by 5 – 7% relative to units further away (Asquith et al.).

More importantly, research has identified that market-rate housing helps mitigate the displacement of lower-income residents from gentrifying neighborhoods.

In San Francisco, Pennington found that the risk of displacement drops by 17% for people living within 500m of new development while the risk of eviction for rent-controlled apartments drops by 31% within 100m (Pennington)

Across the broader set of US metros, Asquith et al. identified a net in-flow of residents from lower-income neighborhoods associated with new market-rate construction — needless to say, but this is the opposite of displacement (Asquith et al.).

Market-rate housing disperses benefits across the housing market thanks to a phenomenon called filtering. Essentially as new market-rate units enter the supply, some families will upgrade from lower-rent units. This upgrade increases the relative supply of housing for the lower-rent units. This cycle of upgrade → increased supply happens at all levels of the market, helping to decrease rents at all market levels.

As cities look to address their housing crisis, boosting market-rate housing is critically important, especially in the face of accelerating displacement and the struggles with building affordable units. While a comprehensive housing policy cannot rely on market-rate housing alone, cities in the US could do a lot to increase supply.
