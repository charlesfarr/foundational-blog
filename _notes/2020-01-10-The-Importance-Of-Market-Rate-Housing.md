Why in the world is the rent so damn high? The simple answer is that housing far outstrips supply, which drives up costs significantly. Since 2001, there has been no growth in median household income, but the cost of rent has risen by nearly 50%.

The result is that nearly 40% of American renters are "rent-burdened," paying at least 30% of their income for rent. This proportion is up 20% from 2001 (32 → 38%).

The only way to address this crisis is to increase the housing supply. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is increasing evidence that market-rate housing can decrease neighborhood rents thanks to new units' supply-effects.

Research from Germany identified a 3% reduction in rent per square meter for every 0.1% increase in the total housing supply (Mense).

Research from San Francisco identified similar reductions in rents from new market-rate housing construction — between 1.2 – 2.3% for units within a 500m radius (Pennington).

Broader research from 11 large US metro areas has found the benefits of building new market-rate housing also exist in lower-income neighborhoods. Large developments (50+ units) decreased rents by 5 – 7% relative to units further away (Asquith et Al).

The benefits of market-rate are not constrained to those who will eventually occupy the units. The research shows that new supply, even at the top of the income distribution, benefits units across quality- and income-levels.

The benefit stems from a phenomenon called the filtering effect.

As new market-rate housing is built, individuals with higher-incomes will lease the new market-rate units. In doing so, they forgo leasing units further down the market. The decreased demand increases the relative supply of units, which helps depress rents. As these units' prices drop, new renters can move into previously unaffordable units. This process repeats itself throughout the rest of the market, "filtering" downwards.

The result is an increase in supply and a decrease in rents across the market, benefitting high-, middle-, and low-income households (Mense).

Research has identified secondary benefits of the construction of market-rate housing, especially for lower-income residents — new market-rate housing actually decreases displacement and only leads to minimal and localized gentrification (Asquith et Al).

In San Francisco, the research found that the risk of displacement drops by 17% for people living within 500m of new development while the risk of eviction for rent-controlled apartments drops by 31% within 100m (Pennington).

Across a broader set of US metros, the construction of market-rate housing in low-income neighborhoods actually resulted in an in-flow of residents from lower-income neighborhoods. This is the opposite of displacement (Asquith et Al).

The gentrification that was identified was very localized, within 100m of the new development. Additionally, there was little evidence of new market-rate housing increasing demand for housing in a neighborhood, which would offset the benefits of increased supply.

In summary, building market-rate housing increase the supply of housing. The resulting supply effects and filtering process lead to decreasing rents across all unit types, easing rent-burdens, and helping to mitigate displacement.

The main takeaway for cities is the need to boost market-rate units, ideally by removing impediments stemming from zoning and permitting.
