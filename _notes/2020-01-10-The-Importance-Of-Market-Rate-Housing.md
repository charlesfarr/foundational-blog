Why in the world is rent so damn high? The simple answer is that demand for rental housing far outstrips supply, driving up rents.

Since 2001,  the cost of rent has risen by nearly 50% while income has stayed flat. Now, almost 40% of renter households in America are "rent-burdened," defined as putting 30% or more of income towards rent (up from 32% in 2001).

However, there is increasing evidence that the simple act of building market-rate housing can decrease neighborhood rents for everyone.

- Mense identified a 3% reduction in rent per square meter for every 0.1% increase in the total housing supply in Germany (Mense).

- Pennington found similar rent reductions from new market-rate housing construction — between 1.2 – 2.3% for units within a 500m radius of construction — in San Francisco (Pennington).

- Asquith et al. found the benefits of building new market-rate housing also manifest in lower-income neighborhoods. Construction of large developments (50+ units) decreased rents by 5 – 7% relative to units further away, an effect observed across the 11 large US metros studied (Asquith et al.).

More importantly, research has identified that market-rate housing helps mitigate the displacement of lower-income residents from gentrifying neighborhoods.

In San Francisco, the risk of displacement drops by 17% for people living within 500m of new development while the risk of eviction for rent-controlled apartments drops by 31% within 100m (Pennington)

Across the broader set of US metros, a net in-flow of residents from lower-income neighborhoods was associated with new market-rate construction — important to note that this is the exact opposite of displacement (Asquith et al.).

Market-rate housing disperses benefits across the housing market thanks to a phenomenon called filtering. As new market-rate units enter the supply, some families will upgrade from lower-rent units, which increases the relative supply of housing for the lower-rent units. This cycle of upgrade resulting in increased supply happens at all levels of the market, helping to distribute rents decreases across the market.

As cities look to address their housing crisis, boosting market-rate housing is critically important, especially in the face of accelerating displacement and the difficulty building affordable units. While a comprehensive housing policy cannot rely on market-rate housing alone, cities in the US could do a lot more to increase supply.
