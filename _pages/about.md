Hi, my name is **Charles Farr**. This is **Foundational**, my blog.

The goal of Foundational is to write about topics related to cities & urbanism, technology, and politics that interest me. What unifies the concepts in my mind is they represent the underpinnings of modern life - the foundation.

Please poke around. If you're interested in getting in contact, feel free to reach out at [info@charlesfarr.com](mailto:info@charlesfarr.com) or on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/charlessimsfarr).
