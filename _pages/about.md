Hi, my name is **Charles Farr**. This is the **Foundational**, my blog.

The goal of Foundational is to write about topics I am interested in. Currently, that means ideas related to urbanism, mobility, and personal knowledge management, but I expect this to change and evolve.

Please poke around. I would love to head from you as well â€” if you're interested in getting in contact, feel free to reach out at [info@charlesfarr.com](mailto:info@charlesfarr.com) or find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/charlessimsfarr).
